# Kologram

## Introduction
Kologram is a simple project tracker programmed majorly with the use of Python programming language in connection with google sheets API to keep track of users' interested projects and store user data in google sheets. The Word Kologram is coined from the word kolo, A word well known to Nigerians as a private "Savings Box". The Application kologram intends to imitate this usage. Kologram allows its user to interact with the program by providing navigation options and input questions to collect user data. Through the usage of kologram, users are expected to better track their desired projects and contributions towards it.

## Features left to be implemented
Kologram intends to make best use of users' data and provide them with every necessary feature to keep track of their project. such features may include processing of data to better usage. include ways of adding notifications and improve the GUI for users convenience.

## Design
* Google Sheets API
    * The Application uses googlesheets API to keep users data. This makes it possible to view project status at any point in time and keep track of the amount outstanding.
* Pandas Module
    * The Application uses pandas module installed in python to display project overview, and existing projects in a much data-like fashion
* Python Input Command
    * Input questions to collect users data
* Python operations 
    * Calculation of dates to derive number of days left for project
    * Calculation to derive project outstanding amounts
* python print statements 
    * Print statements used to provide useful informatu√≠ons to user
    * Print statement used to structure app pages

## Limitations
* Application is a terminal program and hence, it is limited by these possibity. Applications best behaviour is on a desktop or keyboard type computers.
* Screen size is default to heroku's deployment.
